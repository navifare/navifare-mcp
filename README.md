# Navifare MCP Server

**Version**: 0.1.5

Navifare finds a better price for a specific flight the user already found. Users should provide flight details conversationally, which will be structured into the required format.

## Overview

This MCP server wraps the Navifare REST API as MCP tools for flight price comparison. It enables AI assistants like Claude to help users find better prices for flights they've already discovered.

## MCP Endpoint

- **Production**: `https://mcp.navifare.com/mcp`
- **Documentation**: `https://www.navifare.com/mcp` (Auto-updates from the MCP endpoint)
- **Learn more about MCP**: [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

## Tools

### `format_flight_pricecheck_request`

**Title**: Format Flight Request

Parse and format flight details from natural language text or transcribed image content. Extracts flight information (airlines, flight numbers, dates, airports, prices) and structures it for price comparison. Returns formatted flight data ready for flight_pricecheck, or requests missing information if incomplete.

**Annotations**:
- `readOnlyHint`: `true` - Tool only formats/parses data, no external calls
- `destructiveHint`: `false` - Tool does not modify or delete data

**Input Schema**:
- `user_request` (required): Flight details in natural language text. Include all available information: flight numbers, airlines, departure/arrival airports and times, dates, prices, passenger counts, and travel class.

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",

    }
  }
}
```

### `flight_pricecheck`

**Title**: Flight Price Check
