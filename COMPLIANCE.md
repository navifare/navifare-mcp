## Testing Account

For Anthropic review, please contact us at contact@navifare.com to obtain a testing account with sample data.

## Examples

See `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` for three+ working examples demonstrating core functionality:
1. Complete workflow with image extraction
2. Manual input example
3. Price comparison results display

## Remote Server Support

Currently, the server is configured for stdio transport. For remote HTTP support (required for Claude web), the server includes `http-server.js` which can be deployed. Remote servers would need:
- Streamable HTTP transport support (currently SSE, needs upgrade)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication if user data is collected (not currently required)

## Compliance Monitoring

This document is reviewed quarterly and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with Anthropic's MCP Directory Policy.
