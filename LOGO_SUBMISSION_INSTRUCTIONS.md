# MCP Directory Logo Submission - Quick Guide

## ✅ What's Ready

1. **SVG Logo Created**: `logo_squared.svg` has been generated in this directory
2. **Domain**: `navifare.com`
3. **Favicon URL**: `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=navifare.com&sz=64`

## 📝 Form Submission Steps

### Section 1: Server Logo

1. Open the file `logo_squared.svg` in this directory
2. Copy the entire SVG content (the XML code)
3. Paste it into the "Server Logo" field in the submission form

**Note**: The SVG embeds your PNG logo as base64. This works for submission, but if you have the original vector source (Illustrator, Figma, etc.), that would be better quality.

### Section 2: Server Logo Url

1. **Verify the favicon URL**:
   - Open this URL in your browser: `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=navifare.com&sz=64`
   - Check that it shows your Navifare logo/favicon correctly
   
2. **If the favicon is incorrect**:
   - Update the favicon on your website (`https://navifare.com/favicon.ico`)
   - Wait a few hours for Google's cache to update
   - Verify the URL again before submitting

3. **Fill out the form**:
   - Paste the favicon URL: `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=navifare.com&sz=64`
   - Check the box: "I have verified that the favicon is correct"
